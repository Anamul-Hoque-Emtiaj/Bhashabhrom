EEE DAY 2023 Datathon
This repository is for storing my part of EEE day Datathon. Our team '
$মোতিভ্রম$' score 18/52 position in the competition. Though it was a ML Competition. My part was developing an algorithm which can compare wrong bengali sentence(input) with correct bengali sentence(predicted from our ML Model) and give an output indicating different type of mistake in appropriate formate. I also built another algorithm which can generate different types of mistake(noise) in a corrected sentence for training our ML Model.
